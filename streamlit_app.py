### Note about the Streamlit conversion:
For a complete implementation with an animated otter in Streamlit, you would need to create a custom Streamlit component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The animation of the otter's mouth would be handled in JavaScript, similar to how it's done in the React version but adapted for Streamlit's component system.
